          <p class='description'>
            Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, 
			depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, 
			prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat,
			with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.The poultry farming industry
			that accounts for chicken production takes on a 
			range of forms across different parts of the world.
			In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods,
			while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. 
			The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today,
			making them outnumber humans more than two to one.Chicken meat contains about two to three times
			as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.[13]
			Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded).
			The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains
			4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27
			grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak

          <p class='description'>
            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. 
			Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.
			Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
			Beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts roasts,
			short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), 
			while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). 
			Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. 
			The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, 
			such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands 
			(particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where 
			there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles 
			of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). 
			Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is[3], but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.

          <p class='description'>
            Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯꜜɕi] or [sɯɕiꜜ]) is a Japanese dish of specially prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi),
			usually with some sugar and salt, combined with a variety of ingredients (ネタ neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
			Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯). 
			The term sushi is no longer used in its original context and literally means "sour-tasting."
			Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice.
			It is often prepared with seafood, such as calamari, eel, or imitation crab meat. Many others are vegetarian.
			Sushi is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.
			Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish,
			or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
